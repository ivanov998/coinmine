## Why Upload Now?

I recently rediscovered this project and decided to upload it as a part of my personal archives. It reminds me of how much I was able to accomplish at a young age, with no formal experience, and how I should never let that early spark fade.

This is the only version I was able to retrieve, and it is not the final version. Unfortunately, I was unable to recover the most polished and completed build, but this still serves as a great example of what I built back then.

⚠️ **Note:** This project lacks the use of any security mechanisms. Not even **env** files are used
